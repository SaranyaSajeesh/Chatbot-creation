# OpenAI Chatbot

If you are building a chatbot or any other conversational AI application, OpenAI is a great resource to consider. With OpenAI's powerful artificial intelligence technology, you can create chatbots that can understand natural language and generate human-like responses.

## Note:

However, there are a few things to note before you start using the OpenAI API for your chatbot. First and foremost, you need to ensure that your OpenAI Credits have not expired. If your credits have been exhausted, your API requests will be denied until you purchase more credits. You can check your credit usage by clicking on the following link.
